  summary: USGS Modular Hydrologic Model
  description: |
    MODFLOW 6 is an object-oriented program and framework developed to provide
    a platform for supporting multiple models and multiple types of models
    within the same simulation. Within this framework, a regional-scale
    groundwater model may be coupled with multiple local-scale groundwater
    models. Or, a groundwater flow model could be coupled to a groundwater
    transport model of a single solute species.
